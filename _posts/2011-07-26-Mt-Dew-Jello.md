I just sampled my latest culinary experiment: Jello made with 100% Mt. Dew. Initially, this sounded like a great idea, since Mt. Dew has the best flavor of any soda, and its unique citrus taste seemed perfect for Jello. However, the first iteration of this recipe proved to be less than adequate in both taste and texture. Before I describe the changes I plan to make, let me share the recipe:

<small>Mt. Dew Jello. Awesome Wife says it looks like solidified pee. :( <small>

**Ingredients:**

*   2 packets [Knox unflavored gelatine](http://www.kraftbrands.com/knox/)&nbsp;(Beware, 1997 site design)
*   1 cup cold Diet Mt. Dew
*   1.25 cups hot Diet Mt. Dew

**Instructions:**

1.  Pour cold Diet Mt. Dew in an 8in x 6in x 2in glass dish.
2.  Sprinkle the unflavored gelatine on top of the cold Dew. Let sit for 1 minute.
3.  Add the boiling hot Dew. Stir until gelatine is completely dissolved. NOTE: It will be hard to tell if the the gelatine is completely dissolved, since there will be a fair amount of bubbles on top. You can remove these to one side by skimming the surface of the liquid with a fork.
4.  Refrigerate&nbsp;for 3.5 hours.

After reading the box of gelatine, I think I am going to half the amount of Mt. Dew in this next batch; making it firmer - more like Jello Jigglers. I also plan to use non-diet Mt. Dew, to see if that increases the flavor. A final idea I have is to boil the hot Mt. Dew to a light syrup before I add it to the gelatine.

tl;dr: This Jello was only okay. Im going to use real Mt. Dew next time.

Any other suggestions?
