After the mediocre success that was [Diet Mt. Dew Jello](http://eatrunco.de/food/2011/07/26/Mt-Dew-Jello.html), I thought that I would try a beefier; more research driven approach today. I saw the many comments left on Twitter, this blog, and Facebook; you will be pleased to see that I incorporated some of those suggestions.

The most common suggestion from commenters was to use soda fountain syrup. Unfortunately, this isn't something I can buy from my local grocery store - and it[ costs upwards of $35/gallon](http://www.sodabarsystem.com/index_Bag_In_Box_Syrups.htm). However, I did some research on soda fountain syrup, and found out that it is ideally [mixed in a 5:1 ratio of water to syrup](http://www.truetex.com/carbonation.htm). I also found out that even regular bottled soda is derived from the same syrup. Then I had a crazy idea - why not derive my _own_ syrup?

<small>Making syrup. This felt like I was doing something wrong.<small>

Calculator in hand, converting cups to fluid ounces, and using the 5:1 ratio, I found that 8 Fl. Oz. Syrup could be had from 40 Fl. Oz. Soda. I also found that deriving this syrup would take longer than I wanted, since I would have to keep it at a lower heat. In the end, I took 30 Oz. of soda to the desired volume; meaning that it was more like a .25:1 ratio in the final hot syrup product.

The final product? Delicious. I think it could only get better if I used pure hot syrup. Here is my recipe:
