Seth Godin had some sage words today in his blog post "[Wasting time is not a waste](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/08/wasting-time-is-not-a-waste.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+typepad%2Fsethsmainblog+%28Seth%27s+Blog%29)", which seem particularly relevant given my quest to realize my true potential. What does that have to do with doing something [like a boss?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp7jp5H-xWU)

Answer: All of my bosses wasted time. As a lowly grunt, I resented the fact that they made more money, and had cooler titles while _appearing_ to waste time. Now I realize that all of the wasted time was wasted _productively_. Perhaps taking a break from work to learn a **relevant **new skill, improve your physical health, or to simply catch up on much needed sleep _is _a valid option, as long as you get right back to work after you are done.
