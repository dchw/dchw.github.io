A couple years ago, my ward had a cooking contest. In this contest, everything had to have bacon in it in some way, similar to how Iron Chef works. For this contest, I made a [Cinnamon-Bacon ice cream](http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2008/03/candied-bacon-i-1/ "It was based on this recipe.") that won 1st place! It was really quite delicious, and introduced me to the amazing flavors  that can be found in bacon-based desserts.

Then, a few days ago, [MormonMuse](http://www.reddit.com/user/MormonMuse "MormonMuse, the Redditor") on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/ "Reddit!") suggested that I make bacon cookies for an upcoming Redditor meetup. Having done an ice cream in the same vein, I decided to take the challenge and make a cinnamon and bacon cookie

Rather than make just a few cookies, I decided to go all out and make 5 dozen. The reviews from family and friends were great! All of the cookies were eaten within 24 hours of baking.

Here is the recipe (the cookie recipe will only use about half the candied bacon, so double the cookies, or just eat the remaining bacon. Its a win-win situation!):

**Cinnamon and Bacon Cookies**

By Corey Larson

Estimated time to cookies: 1.5 hours

Estimated active cooing time: 35 mins

Ingredients:

*   1 lb. bacon
*   2 cups brown sugar
*   1 cup white sugar
*   1/2 cup butter
*   1 large egg
*   1 tsp vanilla
*   1 1/2 cups flour
*   1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
*   1 tsp baking powder
*   1/4 tsp salt
*   1/4 cup cinnamon sugar

Materials:

*   Large baking sheet
*   Wire cooling rack
*   Tongs
*   Tinfoil
*   Mixing bowl

This recipe can be broken into two stages: Candying the bacon, and making the cookie dough. We will begin by candying the bacon.

**Candying the Bacon**

1.  Preheat the oven to 325°.
2.  Coat the baking sheet with tinfoil. Place the wire cooling rack in the baking sheet.
3.  Put the brown sugar on a plate, or in a wide-mouth bin of some sort.
4.  Dredge the raw bacon in the brown sugar, coating the bacon in as much sugar as you can. I like to rub the sugar into the bacon to give it an even sweeter taste.
5.  Place each strip of sugared bacon on the cooling rack. [It should look like this.](http://i.imgur.com/gxGC9.jpg "BACON BACON BACON") This prevents the sugar from burning onto the bacon. (Burned sugar is **DISGUSTING**)
6.  Place the bacon into the oven. Your bacon should be ready in about 20 minutes. I like to take the bacon out at 10 minutes, and use the tongs to drag each piece through the accumulated grease. This makes the end result more moist. You could also use a baster to get the same effect.
7.  Remove the bacon from the oven after the elapsed time. Use the tongs to get the bacon off the cooling rack, and set it out on a plate to dry.

Dried candied bacon should [look like a cooked piece of bacon, only shinier](http://i.imgur.com/VqX7r.jpg "BACON"), and more flexible when you handle it. Once you have the bacon ready, you can move on to the cookie part! This is much easier than the candying the bacon.

**Making the cookie**

1.  Preheat oven to 350°.
2.  Cream the sugar and butter in mixing bowl.
3.  Beat the egg an vanilla into this mixture. 
4.  Add the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt. Mix well.
5.  This dough is fairly sticky. If you can handle it with your hands at this point, continue to step 5. Otherwise, refrigerate the dough until workable.
6.  Shape dough balls about 1-inch in diameter.
7.  Roll dough balls in cinnamon sugar, coating every available surface.
8.  Place cookie on baking sheet, smashing slightly to flatten.
9.  Bake for about 5-6 minutes, and remove the cookies from the oven.
10.  Break the candied bacon into appropriately size pieces, and push piece into the top of the cookie. The bacon and the cookie should "bond" slightly. You should feel like you are smashing centers of the cookies.
11.  Finish baking the cookies for another 4-5 minutes, or until desired crispiness.
12.  Remove from oven, let cookies cool.
13.  Enjoy!
