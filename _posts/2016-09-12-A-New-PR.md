Today is an amazing day! I have a new marathon PR of [3:39:45](https://www.runrevel.com/bcm/results?pk=1481335)!

I feel great. This race is [_so_ relentlessly downhill](https://www.runrevel.com/bcm/course), you really have to hold back. Mile 18-23 are relatively flat (if even slightly uphill), and I saw **so many** people cruising down the previous 18 miles of downhill stop once they hit this section. I guess they made the same mistake I did the first time on this course when they **went way too fast** down the first 18 miles.

This flat section wasn't a walk in the park for me, either. My pace dropped from a 7:50 mile to a 9:50+ as I did everything I could to keep going for the next six miles. In all my racing, I've never had to dig this deep. It took guts. But I made it through.

Riding the runners high from pushing through the most difficult part of the course, the remaining 3.2 miles were a breeze. As I rounded the last corner, I saw the time was under 3:40:00, which is much faster than I have ever completed a marathon before! Grimacing as I dumped the last of the coal on the fire, I pushed hard and finished with a new PR. To put this in perspective, all my family who were coming to spectate _actually missed my finish_ since they expected me 10-15 minutes later.

This time also clinched me 2nd place in my age group for the [Grand Slam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Grand_Slam), putting me ahead of 3rd place by 25 minutes! If I can run a 4:00:00 at St. George this year(easy), victory is mine for sure. I hope.
